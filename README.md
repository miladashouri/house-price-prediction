# Introduction:

This project predicts the price of houses given their characteristics: This is a kaggle competition: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## Startup:
**The best way to start the model training is through creating a conda envireonment, for example:**

```conda create -n house_price_prediction ```

The dependencies required to run the jupyter notebook file are listed in the requirements.txt. simply run the following:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

After installing the required dependencies, run the jupyter notebook by:

``` jupyter notebook ```

In the jupyter notebook navigator, run the model.ipynb.
